Description: This package provides a layer oriented way of creating neural networks,
    the framework is intended to give the user total control of the internals of a net
    without much effort. Use classes like PerceptronLayer to create a layer of percetron
    neurons, and specify how many you want, that easy! The package does all the tricky
    stuff internally leaving you focused in what you want.
