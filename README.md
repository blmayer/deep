> A small R library for creating deep neural networks


## Note to contributors

This project is in a very initial state and many features are missing:

- new layers, like dropout, pooling, convolution etc
- a better implementation of the backpropagation algorithm
- new training algorithms
- a plot method tho view all neurons and weights in a nice way
- a plot during training, just because it's nice
- anything you propose that makes sense

I intend to convert some methods using RCPP for better performance.
